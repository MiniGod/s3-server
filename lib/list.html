    This is an S3 Server. It proxies your requests to the {{s3Bucket}} S3 bucket. 
    The current path you chose had a '/' at the end and I didn't find an index.html inside it, 
    so here are all the subfolders I found instead:
    <ul>
      {{#prefixes}}
        <li><a href="/{{Prefix}}">{{Prefix}}</a></li>
      {{/prefixes}}
    </ul>

    By the way, if you think this is super ugly and want to make it look better. Here's
    my address: <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/s3-server">https://github.com/signalfx/s3-server</a>.
